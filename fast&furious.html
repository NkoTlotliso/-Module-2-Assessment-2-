        <h3>FAST & FURIOUS 9(2021)</h3>
       <p>F9 (also known as F9: The Fast Saga and Fast & Furious 9) is a 2021 American action film directed by Justin Lin, who also wrote the screenplay with Daniel Casey. It is the sequel to The Fate of the Furious (2017), the ninth main installment, and the tenth full-length film released overall in the Fast & Furious franchise. The first film since Fast & Furious 6 (2013) to be directed by Lin and the first since 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003) not to be written by Chris Morgan, F9 stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, John Cena, Jordana Brewster, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, Michael Rooker, Helen Mirren, Kurt Russell, and Charlize Theron. In the film, Dominic Toretto and the team come together to stop a world-shattering plot headed by Toretto's brother, Jakob.</p>
       <p>With a ninth and tenth film confirmed since 2014, Lin was confirmed to be returning to direct F9 in October 2017. Cena joined the cast in June 2019 and principal photography began that same month and lasted until that November, with filming locations including London, Los Angeles, Tbilisi, and Thailand.</p>
       <p>F9 was originally scheduled for worldwide release in April 2020, but was delayed several times, first due to the releases of Hobbs & Shaw (2019) and No Time to Die (2021), and then the COVID-19 pandemic. It premiered in South Korea and was released internationally on May 19, 2021, and released in the United States on June 25. The film received mixed reviews with praise for the stunts and Lin's direction but criticism for its unrealistic action sequences and formulaic script. It has grossed over $423 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2021.</p>
