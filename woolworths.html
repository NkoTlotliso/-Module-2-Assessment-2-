        <h3>WOOLWORTHS</h3>
        <P>Woolworths Group was a listed British company that owned the High Street retail chain Woolworths. It also owned other companies such as the entertainment distributor Entertainment UK, and book and resource distributor Bertram Books.

            The Woolworths store chain was the main enterprise of the group. Originally a division of the American F. W. Woolworth Company until its sale in the early 1980s,[2][3] it had more than 800 stores in the UK prior to closure. Woolworths sold many goods and had its own Ladybird children's clothing range,[4] WorthIt! value range and Chad Valley toys.[5] They were also well known for selling Candyking "pick 'n' mix" sweets.[6] It was sometimes referred to as "Woolies" by the UK media, the general public, and occasionally in its own television commercials.[7][8] The British company also owned and ran F. W. Woolworth Ireland until 1984 and Woolworths (Cyprus) until 2003.</P>
        <P>On 26 November 2008, trading of shares in Woolworths Group was suspended, and its Woolworths and Entertainment UK subsidiaries entered administration.[9] Deloitte closed all 807 Woolworths stores between 27 December 2008 and 6 January 2009, resulting in 27,000 job losses.[10] Woolworths Group plc entered administration on 27 January 2009,[11] and it was officially dissolved on 13 October 2015.[12]

            In February 2009, Shop Direct Group purchased the Woolworths trademark and internet address, which continued as a retail website until its closure in June 2015. As of April 2017, after former director Tony Page expressed a wish to buy the Woolworths name from Shop Direct, there was talk of Woolworths making a comeback to British high streets.[13]</P>
        <p>The Woolworths brand and domain was bought by Shop Direct Group, owned by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, on 2 February 2009. The company announced it would relaunch Woolworths as an online retail store. The website was launched on 26 June 2009.[92] It was entirely independent of the former Woolworths Group. It has been closed until further notice since June 2015. On 13 October 2015, the company finally dissolved and the website went defunct. In April 2017, multiple news sources reported that Woolworths may possibly be re-opening, nearly nine years since it closed, after former director Tony Page confirmed interest in acquiring the Woolworths name from Shop Direct.[93] As of April 2021, the 'woolworths.co.uk' URL redirects to Very.co.uk.
